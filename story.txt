Starting (Deming Xu)
In the middle of the night, Jake was sleeping. Suddenly, a man passed by the window. The man carried a knife and entered Jake's house. Jake didn't know anything, but his dream. 
Then the man opened the door of the bedroom, and he compared Jake's face with the photo in his hand. He confirmed that Jake is the target. 
He quietly walked to the bed and raised the knife. However, because of the darkness, the man accidentally broke the vase next to him. 
Jake was awake, and he saw the man with a knife! "Who is there?", Jake said. "Someone tries to kill you!", the man answered. Then, two people began to fight in the bedroom.

Middle (Brandon Kuhl)
Jake managed to force the man off of him and twisted his wrist. The knife dropped to the floor. The man reached with his other hand only for Jake to grasp his  wrist. 
Clutching both the man's wrists, Jake kicked away the knife. Jake held the man and screamed, "Why are you doing this?" A strange voice emerged from the darkness behind him, 
"You know what you did, Jake." As Jake turned around, he felt a sharp blow to his back.

Ending (Christopher Semler)
Jake fell to the floor. As Jake laid there gasping for air, he heard a familiar voice. His girlfriend Victoria. "How can you cheat on me, Jake? And with my sister??"
Jake pulled all the energy he had left. "What are you talking about? I would never cheat!" Victoria replied, "Then why did her talking to you over FaceTime?"
With Jake's last breath, he said, "We were planning a surprise party for you." Then Jake died.
When Victoria realized she messed up and it was just a misunderstanding, she saw police lights pull up outside. Jake is gone, and it was all just a misunderstanding.
