Starting (Deming Xu)
In the middle of the night, Jake was sleeping. Suddenly, a man passed by the window. The man carried a knife and entered Jake's house. Jake didn't know anything, but his dream. Then the man opened the door of the bedroom, and he compared Jake's face with the photo in his hand. He confirmed that Jake is the target. He quietly walked to the bed and raised the knife. However, because of the darkness, the man accidentally broke the vase next to him. Jake was awake, and he saw the man with a knife! "Who is there?", Jake said. "Someone tries to kill you!", the man answered. Then, two people began to fight in the bedroom.
